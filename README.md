# Recipes Vue App

Welcome to the Recipes Vue App project! This is a front-end project developed as part of a study on Vue.js. The application consumes a public recipe API, allowing users to search for recipes based on various criteria such as cuisine type, ingredients, name, etc. Additionally, the application enables users to view the steps required to prepare the selected recipe.

## Key Features

- **Recipe Search**: Users can search for recipes based on different criteria, including cuisine type, ingredients, and name.
- **Detailed View**: Upon selecting a recipe, users can view details, including ingredients and preparation steps.
- **Responsive Layout**: The project uses Vuetify to ensure a responsive layout and a consistent user experience across different devices.
- **Routing with VueRouter**: VueRouter is employed to manage navigation between different sections of the application.
